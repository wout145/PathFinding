# Path Finding

This project is an implementation of a collection of pathfinding algorythms in C. I am writing these algorythms from scratch to the best of my ability. 

See the list of algorythms below:

- [x]  Single Path Search algorythm
- [x]  Breadth First Search algorythm
- [ ]  Depth First Search algorythm
- [ ]  Dijkstra's algorythm
- [ ]  A* algorythm

I am aiming to add visualization for these algorythms after I have finished implementing them.

Currently, the output still contains a lot of debugging information. To change which algorythm is used, this has to be changed in the main function. No arguments are any userfriendliness of the kind has been added yet. The goal is to implement the algorythms succesfully first, and then add extra features.

Suggestions are always welcome.
